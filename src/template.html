              If you're looking for a warm meal and a stiff drink, you've come
              to the right place. Our venison stew will keep you going through
              the coldest Skyrim nights, and a mug of Honningbrew Mead is sure
              to lift your spirits. Just don't ask too many questions about the
              inn's historyâ€”you might not like the answers.
